mplaylist
=========

A simple `mpv <https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv>`_ playlist manager
written in Qt.

Instructions
============

You probably want to create a directory somewhere and check this out there.

    git clone https://github.com/cmdrkotori/mplaylist.git
    
    cd mplaylist
    
    qtcreator mplaylist.pro

The application calls mpv to play files, so Windows users please make sure the
binaries are in the same directory or mpv is in your path.  You may want to
install mpv with `chocolatey <https://chocolatey.org/>`_ for this purpose.
